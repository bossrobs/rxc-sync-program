RxC Sync Program ( Ran X Crypto )


<h1>How to use?</h1>

```
Edit session.txt

address|private_key (insert your wallet address and private_key in session.txt)

Place session.txt and program in same folder

```

if you successfully input your address and private_key you can now run the program :)<br>
Make sure you use pilot mode ;) i don't recommend u using main wallet :D lovelots.

<h1>Take note</h1>
 <p>
Sharing your main wallet private key could hack ur nfts/wallet balance</br></br>
 So i am recommending you to make a dummy wallet then use it in this program :) </p>
